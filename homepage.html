    <h2>Project Insights</h2>
    <p>The web site should contain your interactive visualization, summarize the main results of the project, and tell a story. 
    Consider your audience (the site should be public public) and keep the level of discussion at the appropriate level.
     </p>
     <p>For our project, we created a visualization to explore how the Big Mac Index relates to other economic indicators and look at the changes over time across countries around the world.
     </p>
     <p>For those who don’t know, the Big Mac Index is a metric created by the Economist that is based on purchasing power parity, or the idea that exchange rates over time should move towards equality across national borders in the price charged for an identical basket of goods, in this case, a McDonalds Big Mac. Unlike a basket of goods or groceries, which looks very different in composition around the world, a Big Mac is mostly the same. However, as we will find with the data, the price does not always reflect that.  
     </p>
     <p>
     We wanted our visualization to serve as an exploratory tool to allow users who don’t have a ton of background in finance to gain some insight into these indices. The goal of the Big Mac Index is to make exchange-rate theory more digestible, so we wanted to stay true to that mission here. Our goal is for users to come away from our visualization knowing even just a little bit more about an aspect of this data that they find most interesting.  
     </p>
     <p>
     To make our visualization, we reviewed papers proposing applications of data vis to finances, and learned the importance of keeping the search tools simple and intuitive while giving users the options to explore the information how they want. The map view allows people to view the current values of the indices around the world quickly, and hower for more detailed information. The indicies we chose to highlight in addition to the Big Mac index were GDP per capita, Unemployment Rate, and Literacy Rate. 
     </p>
     <p>
     Then, if we click on India here, the side view allows users to view this information over the past few years and view the trends associated with these values. Users can also choose another country and view a side-by side comparison of two countries to look at some of the similarities. If we select Thailand, we can see how these values compare over time for each country.  
     </p>
     <p>
     We think that having more than one option for exploring this data allows users to choose how they want to use the visualization which allows them to get the most out of it based on their own preferences. If they want to focus on present-day data around the world, the map view can show them that. If they want to look at data over time, they can use the side panel. By keeping everything on one page we also made it easy to switch between views, which helps make the visualization more digestible.
